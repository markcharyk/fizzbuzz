This original FizzBuzz fizzbuzz.py is designed to return "Fizz" if an input number is divisible by three and "Buzz" if divisible by five.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, the result will be "FizzBuzz".
If divisible by neither, it returns a string representation of the number.
Ex: fizzbuzz(15) -> "FizzBuzz"
fizzbuzz(14) -> "14"

The extensible version fizzbuzz-ext.py lets you add a dictionary with key/value pairs for adding extra syllables (for example, "Sivv" for numbers divisible by 7).
When called as a file the program will propt the user to build the dictionary manually.
Ex: fizzbuzz (12, {2:"Twozz", 3:"Threez", 5:"Fivez"}) -> "TwozzThreez"
